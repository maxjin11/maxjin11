- 👋 Hi, I’m @maxjin11, an incoming UWaterloo Mathematics student (1A in fall '23) from Ontario, Canada.
- 💪 Status: Chilling out for the summer!

- 👀 I’m interested in programming, music production, basketball, badminton, and various video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Racket in preparation for my university course (CS 135) and learning R on the side.
- 😎 In the past, I have learned Java through my high school's computer science course, and Python3 through Linkedin Learning.
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on small projects in order to add to my programming experience.
